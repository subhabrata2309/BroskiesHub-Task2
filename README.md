Task 2: Create a To-Do List Application


Features
Add new tasks

Automatically saves tasks to tasks.txt

How It Works
When the program starts, it loads tasks from tasks.txt (creates it if not found).

The user is prompted to:
1 → Add a task
2 → Delete a task
3 → View all tasks
0 → Exit the program

After any change, the task list is saved to tasks.txt.
